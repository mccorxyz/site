<h1>New Site Layout</h1>
<p class='date'>Sun, 27 Feb 2022 19:20:51 -0600</p>
<p>After a couple years of having my site built using bootstrap, I finally decided to man up and use plain CSS instead.
I was finding that everytime I had something to post on the blog, I would have to refresh myself on bootstrap.
This was a pain to manage, as my CSS would have overrides for certain bootstrap classes and it just wasn't the cleanest way to aproach something as simple as a static-based blog website.</p>
<p>Now, I'm utilizing <a href="https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/lb" target="_blank">lb</a> by <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz" target="_blank">Luke Smith</a> to handle my new blog posts.
Before, when posting, I would have to not only write the new post's html page from a snippet, I'd also have to update my index.html, blog index, and rss manually.
lb now does all of that automatically for me!</p>
<p>The new layout was inspired by <a href="https://www.denshi.org" target="_blank">Denshi's webpage</a> (Denshi also has a <a href="https://youtube.com/DenshiVideo" target="_blank">youtube channel</a> that I've enjoyd poking around), so go check out both of those.</p>
